# EZMNDVS
This is a small project I created after frustratedly not being able to get a MN DVS Road Test Exam appointment.

Funnily while working on this I happened to see an exam opening for my nearest DVS so unfortunately this project will be put on indefinite hiatus.

However, most of the functionality is already working and if anyone else is looking for something similar feel free the code I've written it should be very easy to copy and paste some of my existing code to add the final missing functionality of booking and confirming the appointment.

Features:
- Will automatically navigate to first time road test appointment section on the MN DVS website.
- Will then fill in your Driver's License information and DOB and click some ToS agreements before going to the appointments listing section.
- Will reload the site every 5 seconds checking for new appointments.
- Will then click the first exam location or an exam location matching the name you specified and then select the appointment time and click the next button.
- Will constantly check and click the "OK" button that checks for AFK avoiding being kicked out of the session. (This in theory should hold your appointment position for when you return to your computer however I'm not completly sure if this actually works.)

MISSING features:
- Dosen't yet fill in your phone number + email on the final screen.
- Doesn't yet click the final submit button to confirm your appointment.
